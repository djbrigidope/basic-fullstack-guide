# basic-fullstack-guide
A helpful guided tour of a super simple full stack app

Stuff I did first.

I created this repo with a Node .gitignore file.  I have installed npm, postgresql, and express generator.  This is how you do those things.  I have created a database.
```
express --view=pug
npm install
```

Then you can 
```
npm start
```
and go to localhost 3000 to see a basic website.

```
npm install -S pg-promise
``` 
To install PG-promise and save it to our package.json so you don't have to install it yourself!
